[Under Development] Emotion analyser tool for programmers


## Description

This desktop application tracks the facial expressions while human is working on the computer and detects emotion changes: tiredness, angriness, apathy - while coding. When the program detects tiredness during some interval (e.x 1-2 minutes)- it shows a pop-up/notification with suggestion to make a short brake.

## Stack of technologies

- The desktop application will be written using `PyQT5` framework and will be written purely in Python.
- As a database we will use `PostgreSQL` - the most popular database.
- ML emotion analyser component will be written in Pytorch/Pytorch-Lightning libraries.


## How to launch application

I am planning to host application only on linux machines. It will be hosted on AUR repositories or there would be instructions on how to install application directly from github repository.

## Contributing

This project is planned to be a small pet project and be made only by myself. If you want to participate in the development process - write to me and we will try to work together.
